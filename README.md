## **Business Understanding Of A Telecom Industry Customer Churn**

Orange S.A., formerly France Télécom S.A., is a French multinational telecommunications corporation. The Orange Telecom's Churn Dataset, consists of cleaned customer activity data (features), along with a churn label specifying whether a customer canceled the subscription.
Explore and analyze the data to discover key factors responsible for customer churn and come up with ways/recommendations to ensure customer retention.

### **CONCLUSIONS:**

After performing exploratory data analysis on the data set, this is what we have incurred from data:

There are some states where the churn rate is high as compared to others may be due to low network coverage.

Area code and Account length do not play any kind of role regarding the churn rate so,it's redundant data columns

In the International plan those customers who have this plan are churn more and also the international calling charges are so high and the customer who has the plan unsatisfied with network issues and high call charge

IN the voice mail section when there are more than 20 voice-mail messages then there is a churn so it basically means that the quality of voice mail is not good.

Total day call minutes, total day calls, Total day charge, Total eve minutes, Total eve calls, Total eve charge, Total night minutes, Total night calls, Total night charge, these columns didn't play any kind of role regarding the churn rate.

In international calls data shows that the churn rate of those customers is high, those who take the international plan so it means that in international call charges are high also there is a call drop or network issue.

In Customer service calls data shows us that whenever an unsatisfied customer called the service center the churn rate is high, which means the service center didn't resolve the customer issue.

### **RECOMENDATIONS:**

* Improve network coverage churned state
* In international plan provide some discount plan to the customer
* Improve the voice mail quality or take feedback from the customer
* Improve the service of call center and take frequently feedback from the customer
* customer regarding their issue and try to solve it as soon as possible
